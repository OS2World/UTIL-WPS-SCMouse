SCMouse provides the easy access to Warp Center when it is
overlapped by other windows (VIEW.EXE for example).
After starting SCMouse.exe, it's possible
to make Warp Center visible by moving the mouse pointer
to the edge of screen were Warp Center is placed.
To stop SCMouse activity, run SCMouse.exe once more.

  This program is free and can be used for any purposes,
but without any warranties.

The small executable requires EMX 0.9d runtime libraries.
